# OFP-FEMA-ecosystem-indicators 2023
Repository for the Ecosystem and Climate Indicators paper provided to SC19 in August 2023.

SPF-OFP 2023. Ecosystem and Climate Indicators. 19th Regular Session of the Scientific
Committee of the WCPFC, SC19/EB-WP-01, Koror, Palau, 16-24 August 2023. (https://meetings.wcpfc.int/node/19391) 

## Details and methodologies
- Updated R code to compile indicators for the three 'Report Cards' presented in Annex 2 of SC19/EB-WP-01, as follows: 
Report Card 1: Environment Indicators
Report Card 2: Annual Tuna Catch & Fishing Effort Indicators
Report Card 3: Biology and Bycatch Indicators

## Key changes since the SC18 paper
- Report Cards layout was updated, and content simplified to better capture important trends using fewer indicators. 
- The time series now cover 1990 to 2021 or 2022 inclusive. 
- A new indicator was added capturing the temporal trend in the proportion of purse seine effort inside High Seas areas.
- The R code provided links directly with datasets housed on SPC's network drives. Contact Jed Macdonald (jedm@spc.int) for specific data requests.
