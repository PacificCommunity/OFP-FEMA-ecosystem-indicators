Repository for the Ecosystem and Climate Indicators for the WCPO paper provided to SC18.

SPF-OFP 2022. Ecosystem and Climate indicators for the WCPO. 18th Regular Session of the Scientific
Committee of the WCPFC, WCPFC-SC18-2021/EB-WP-01

## Details and methodologies
- Updated R code to compile a subset of indicators presented to SC17 in 2021. These indicators related to:
1) Catch and distribution 
2) Fishing Effort
3) Target species condition
- The time series now cover 1990 to 2020 or 2021 inclusive. 
- We add a new indicator capturing the temporal trend in the proportion of purse seine effort inside high seas areas (HS).
- We note that the paper to SC18 does not present these new data - instead it it was designed to open discussion on  a  process  for  adopting  indicators  and communicating  trends
  and trigger points derived from those indicators (either to WCPFC or external stakeholders).
